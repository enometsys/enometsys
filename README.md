### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nad and I like coding.

I have been coding since the art has been introduced to me which led me to choose Computer Science as my undegrad.

For the past 5 years, I am mostly involved in developing APIs specially for healthcare apps like [EMRs](https://www.healthit.gov/faq/what-electronic-health-record-ehr) and full blown [CMSs](https://www.govhealthit.com/what-is-a-clinic-management-system-a-brief-overview-definition/)

Although I mainly work professionally using nodejs and mongodb, in my spare time, I also further my knowldge and skills on my other interests:
- kubernetes
- gRPC
- blockchain
- zero-knowledge
